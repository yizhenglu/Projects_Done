with cte as
(
select id, num, lead(num,1) over ( order by id asc) as nextnum, lead(num,2) over (order by id asc) as nextnum2
from logs

)

select distinct num as "ConsecutiveNums"
from cte
where num = nextnum and num = nextnum2

1.lead 窗口 向前查看第一个， 向前查看第两个
1. 前面一个= 当前的，然后第前两个= num



with a as (
select *,lag(num,1) over(order by id) as num1, lag(num,2) over(order by id) num2 from Logs
) 

select distinct num as ConsecutiveNums from a where num= num1 and num=num2;

1.lag 就是向后走
